## How to contribute to Switchgear

It is really great that you are showing interest in the Switchgear project. Our Team always highly appreciate any help and improvements.   

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/smaato/switchgear/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/smaato/switchgear/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change at <betelgeuse@smaato.com> and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

Feel free to reach out at <betelgeuse@smaato.com>.
